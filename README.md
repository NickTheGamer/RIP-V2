# RIP-V2 implementation

RIP_daemon.py is the file you're looking for.
The daemon is run in the command line using Python3 RIP_daemon.py configuration_file.txt <- replace with file you want to use

Each Simulated router is run using a .txt config file which sets up the routers id, neighbours and initial path costs.
Each Router should be run as its own process.
